"""Package the broker Lambda. The ONE definition of what ships to AWS.

Used by `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (so a dependency bump that breaks the import or
blows the size budget fails on the pull request) and by `release.yml` (which publishes
the artifact). A local build and a released artifact produced by different means is a
difference nobody discovers until production behaves unlike the test.

WHAT SHIPS: `app/` minus `main.py`, plus the resolved wheels for `pyjwt[crypto]` and
`httpx`. Nothing else.

  * `app/main.py` is EXCLUDED BY NAME. It is the only module that imports FastAPI, and
    FastAPI is not in the shipped set — including it turns a working deploy into an
    ImportError at cold start on a path nobody watches.
  * `boto3`/`botocore` are never bundled. The Lambda runtime supplies them and our own
    copy would add ~50 MB.

THE OUTPUT IS DETERMINISTIC. Every entry gets a fixed timestamp and mode, and the walk
is sorted rather than whatever the filesystem returns. Without that, two builds of
identical source produce different bytes, the sha256 comparison in the release workflow
never matches, and every chargate release opens a version-bump PR in magmamoose/infra
that redeploys the same code — exactly the noise the comparison exists to prevent.
Input determinism comes from `broker/uv.lock` via `--frozen`.

`--platform` IS REQUIRED AND HAS NO DEFAULT. `cryptography` ships compiled wheels, so a
build on a developer's macOS ARM machine would silently produce a zip that ImportErrors
inside Lambda. Making the caller name the target platform means that mistake cannot be
made by omission.
