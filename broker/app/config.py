"""Broker configuration — the Chargate GitHub App identity + OIDC policy.

Two runtimes, one settings class:

* **AWS Lambda** (production) — non-secret values arrive as function environment
  variables; ``APP_ID`` and ``PRIVATE_KEY`` come from SSM Parameter Store under
  ``SECRET_PATH`` and are overlaid on top of ``os.environ`` by :func:`load_config`.
* **Local / CI** — everything is in the process environment, ``SECRET_PATH`` is
  unset, the overlay is empty, and nothing imports boto3 at all.

**No pydantic.** This module used to be a ``pydantic_settings.BaseSettings``. It is a
frozen dataclass now because ``pydantic`` + ``pydantic_core`` is ~5 MB of the Lambda
zip and the dominant cold-start term, to validate six strings. The public surface —
the field names, ``allowed()``, ``permissions()``, and keyword construction — is
unchanged, which is what keeps ``tests/test_config.py`` and ``tests/test_broker.py``
pointed at the same API.

The App private key arrives as a PEM string; secret stores commonly ``\\n``-escape
it, so we un-escape (mirrors caldrith's ``settings`` normalizer). PKCS#1 (the
``BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY`` form GitHub hands out) is loaded as-is — ``pyjwt[crypto]``
uses ``cryptography``, which reads it directly.
